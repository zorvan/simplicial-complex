## [0.2.0] - V2: From Detection to Discovery

### Added

- **Content-based clustering** (`data/clustering.ts`): TF-IDF vectorization with k-means clustering
- **Semantic domain source**: New `domainSource` setting with options `folder`, `content-cluster`, `hybrid`

- **Betti display settings**: `enableBettiComputation`, `bettiDisplayOnCanvas`, `maxBettiDim`
- **Interaction reinforcement settings**: `enableInteractionReinforcement`, `reinforcementStrength`
- **Filtration slider setting**: `showFiltrationSlider`
- **Explanation panel setting**: `enableExplanationPanel`

### Changed

## [0.1.0] - Initial Development Version

### Core Features

- Organic blob renderer with metaball capsule-union approach
- Force-directed layout with Barnes-Hut O(n log n) optimization
- Sleep mode for zero idle CPU usage
- Dual view modes: organic blobs and formal geometric rendering
- Hover focus system with ambient context revelation
- Dimension filter (edges, clusters, cores)
- Node pinning with persistence across sessions
- Rename tracking without losing layout positions
- Real-time vault change detection and updates

### Simplices

- Inline shorthand syntax (△, △△)
- YAML frontmatter with metadata (label, weight)
- Automatic face generation (capped at dimension 4)
- Two persistence modes: source-note and central-file

### Inference

- Edge inference from links, tags, title/content overlap, folders
- Suggestion system for triangle closures and soft clusters
- Temporal decay for older simplices
- Simplex centrality measures

### Analysis

- Betti number display (β₀, β₁, β₂)
- Simplex centrality per node and global hub identification
- Filtration controls with weight/confidence/decayed-weight metrics

### Interaction

- Context menu for node/simplex actions
- Lasso-select creation
- Promote simplex to note
- Dissolve simplex
- Metadata side panel with editing capabilities
- Lifecycle state progression for inferred simplices

### Performance

- Progressive loading for large vaults
- Viewport culling for render efficiency
- Text measurement caching
- Debounced settings saves
